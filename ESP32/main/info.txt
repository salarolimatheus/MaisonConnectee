// -> IAQ Accuracy=0 could either mean:
//  * BSEC was just started, and the sensor is stabilizing (this lasts normally 5min in LP mode or 20min in ULP mode),
//  * there was a timing violation (i.e. BSEC was called too early or too late), which should be indicated by a warning/error flag by BSEC,
// -> IAQ Accuracy=1 means the background history of BSEC is uncertain. This typically means the gas sensor data was too stable for BSEC to clearly define its references,
// -> IAQ Accuracy=2 means BSEC found a new calibration data and is currently calibrating,
// -> IAQ Accuracy=3 means BSEC calibrated successfully.
